I am a comp sci major and in my free time I enjoy building classic mopars. My most recent project car is a 1970 duster. It was my father's first drag car that he built and raced in the early 90's before I was born. This year was the first time it has been back on the road and its crazy to me that im almost the same age he was when he was first driving the same car.

I did my branch name using my first name because I don't like the idea of my last name being posted publicly.
I like videogames, playing piano and coding.
